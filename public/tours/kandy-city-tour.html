  <h1>Kandy City Tour</h1>

  <p>Welcome to our <strong>Kandy City Tour package!</strong> Before we get into the details of the package, let us share a little about Kandy City.</p>

  <p>Kandy serves as the capital of Sri Lanka’s central highlands and holds great significance in the country’s history and culture. This city is particularly important to Buddhists worldwide, as it is home to the <strong>Temple of the Tooth Relic</strong>.</p>

  <p>With a rich history spanning over 600 years, Kandy was established as the capital by King Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu in the 15th century. Subsequent Sinhalese kings chose this city as their stronghold due to its natural defenses. In 1815, the British took control of Kandy, marking the end of the reign of the last king in Sri Lankan history, Sri Wicrama Rajasinghe. The city remained under British rule until independence in 1948.</p>

  <p>Kandy is recognized as a <strong>UNESCO World Heritage City</strong>, nestled beside the Mahaweli River. With its pleasant climate, mountains, and cultural attractions, it is a must-visit destination in Sri Lanka.</p>
