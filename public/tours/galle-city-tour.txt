Places to Visit During Our Galle City Tour

Galle Fort

Galle Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of Sri Lanka’s most iconic landmarks. Originally built by the Portuguese in the late 16th century, it was later fortified by the Dutch during the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, the fort’s historic walls and buildings stand as a testament to its rich colonial past.

Inside Galle Fort, you’ll find government offices, boutique shops, and restaurants, creating a vibrant cultural atmosphere. Notable landmarks include the Galle Lighthouse and the Old Clock Tower. The fort also offers breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean, making it an ideal spot to enjoy both sunrise and sunset.

National Maritime Museum

Also located within Galle Fort, the National Maritime Museum (sometimes called the National Maritime Archaeology Museum) is a must-visit for history and maritime enthusiasts. Opened in 1992, the museum originally showcased marine flora and fauna, as well as artifacts connected to seafaring, maritime trade, and fishing.

Although it was heavily damaged by the 2004 tsunami, the museum was restored and reopened in 2010 with support from the Netherlands. Today, visitors can explore a wide range of exhibits including:

Artifacts recovered from shipwrecks along Sri Lanka’s southern coast, some nearly 800 years old

Models of naval craft and marine life

Maps, ropes, earthenware, barrels, beer mugs, smoking pipes, and sailor shoes

Artillery guns and other relics from maritime archaeology

The museum provides a fascinating glimpse into Sri Lanka’s seafaring heritage and the historical importance of maritime trade in the region.

Unawatuna Beach

Located just 5 kilometers from Galle, Unawatuna Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in Sri Lanka’s southern province. Its golden sands, turquoise waters, and swaying palm trees make it a paradise for relaxation and recreation.

Unawatuna is ideal for swimming, even for children, thanks to its shallow waters near the shore. Visitors can also rent sunbeds to soak up the sun while enjoying spectacular views of the Indian Ocean. The beach is perfect for both a leisurely stroll and a refreshing swim.

Meeran Mosque

The Meeran Jumma Mosque, also known as the Galle Fort Mosque, is a historical mosque located within the fort. The current two-story building was commissioned in 1904 by Ahmed Haji Ismail, built on the site of a former Portuguese Catholic church.

Historical evidence suggests that a mosque may have existed here as early as the 1750s, predating the Portuguese occupation. The mosque is named in honor of Meeran Saheb from South India, a patron saint for sailors traveling to and from Sri Lanka.

Architecturally, the mosque features a blend of Victorian and Baroque styles with intricate Islamic detailing, making it not only a spiritual landmark but also an architectural gem within Galle Fort.
