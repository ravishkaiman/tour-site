  <div class="section">
    <p>
      Galle is one of the major cities of Sri Lanka and is situated 116km away from the capital, Colombo. 
      It is considered the provincial capital and the largest city in the southern province of the country. 
      The city is a popular tourist attraction with a mix of cultural and historical values.

      Later, the city became significant for Portuguese, Dutch, and British rule between 1505 and 1948. 
      If you are a foreigner looking for the best destinations to visit in Sri Lanka,

    <h2>Places to Visit During the Galle City Tour</h2>

    <h3>Galle Fort</h3>
    <p>
      Galle Fort is one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Sri Lanka. 
      First built by the Portuguese in the late 16th century, it was later fortified by the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
      Today, visitors can see these historical walls and buildings, along with government offices, restaurants, and shops inside the fort. 
      The <strong>Galle Lighthouse</strong> and <strong>Old Clock Tower</strong> are iconic landmarks. 
      The fort is also one of the best places to witness both sunrise and sunset.
    </p>

    <h3>National Maritime Museum</h3>
    <p>
      Also known as the <em>National Maritime Archaeology Museum</em>, this museum is located within Galle Fort. 
      First opened in 1992, it displayed flora, fauna, and artifacts of the nearby Indian Ocean, 
      including models of whales and fish. The 2004 tsunami damaged the museum, but it was reopened in 2010 with Dutch support. 
      Exhibits now include <strong>artifacts from shipwrecks</strong>, naval craft, ropes, earthenware, barrels, sailor shoes, 
      and artillery guns — some dating back nearly 800 years.
    </p>

    <h3>Unawatuna Beach</h3>
    <p>
      Just 5 km away from Galle, <strong>Unawatuna Beach</strong> is one of the most beautiful beaches in Sri Lanka. 
      Its golden sands, turquoise waters, and palm-lined coast create a stunning view. 
      The shallow waters make it a safe spot for children to swim, and it is also ideal for sunbathing and relaxing by the ocean.
    </p>

    <h3>Meeran Jumma Mosque</h3>
    <p>
      Located inside Galle Fort, the <strong>Meeran Jumma Mosque</strong> was built in 1904 by Ahmed Haji Ismail on the site of a former Portuguese church. 
      Some believe a mosque existed here since the 1750s. 
      The mosque is named after Meeran Saheb of South India, a patron saint of sailors. 
      Architecturally, the mosque blends Victorian and Baroque styles with Islamic details, 
      making it one of the unique religious landmarks in Galle.
